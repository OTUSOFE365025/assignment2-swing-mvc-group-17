Example of an MVC design based on Swing. Answer questions 1 & 2 in this README file.

Question 1:
Swing is a GUI toolkit for Java. The JFC library extends AWT and offers about four times the number of UI components. While it includes standard components such as buttons, checkboxes, and labels, it also introduces new elements like scroll panes, trees, tables, and lists. Its heavy customizability, lightweight components, and rich controls make Swing a favourable toolkit to implement. Swing fits with MVC architecture: each visual component has three aspectsâ€”the way it appears when rendered, the way it reacts to user interaction, and the state information it maintains.

Question 2:
The example utilizes the swing framework and implements the MVC pattern. The Model.java file is responsible for storing the name that is entered in the field, the View.java file is responsible for displaying the interface by utilizing the swing framework, and the Controller.java file is responsible for connecting the Model.java file and the View.java file; when a user interacts with an entity from the View.java file, like pressing a button for instance, the controller would capture that input, and update the model, and then shows feedback through the view. It differs from the conventional MVC pattern discussed in the lecture mainly in the way updates flow between them. Conventionally, the model notifies the view automatically when anything changes through an Observer-style mechanism, while in this example, which utilizes the swing framework, the model in this case is passive and the controller directly updates both the model and the view, which makes the design a lot simpler for smaller programs but less flexible and maintainable for larger systems.
