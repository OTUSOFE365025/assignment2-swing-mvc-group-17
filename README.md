Example of an MVC design based on Swing. Answer questions 1 & 2 in this README file.

Question 1:
Swing is a GUI toolkit for Java. The JFC library extends AWT and offers about four times the number of UI components. While it includes standard components such as buttons, checkboxes, and labels, it also introduces new elements like scroll panes, trees, tables, and lists. Its heavy customizability, lightweight components, and rich controls make Swing a favourable toolkit to implement. Swing fits with MVC architecture: each visual component has three aspectsâ€”the way it appears when rendered, the way it reacts to user interaction, and the state information it maintains.
